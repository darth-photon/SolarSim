## Solar System Simulator

This is a fun side project I did to learn Pygame and to make simulations for my research presentations. The simulator models the solar system with a focus on the physics of planetary motion.

### How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and Pygame installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `main.py`.

### Features

* Models the solar system with realistic physics.
* Uses Pygame for rendering.
* Allows for time acceleration and deceleration.

### Future Improvements

* Add more celestial bodies.
* Improve the accuracy of the physics model.
* Add more user controls for the simulation.
